# Retro List
The future of list apps, in a retro style. It's your typical app where you can add items, but there are sneaky bugs. Expect the unexpected!

# Running the app
Remember to run `flutter pub get`

# User Guidelines
Just open up the app and start adding items to your list!
The app will automatically save when items are added so once you are done listing things, just close the app. It's as simple as that. 

There might be a bug or two every now and then, but you'll be able to deal with them on your own. 

# FAQ
Will the bug really give my item back if I win the fight?
- Yes, indeed.

Why is this game so fun?
- It is what it is. You're welcome!

Will there be more features in the future?
- Yes, so keep an eye out.

Can I add emojis to my list?
- Emojis might come up when you type in a word like cheese or meat, lemons, hamburgers.. there are a lot of words that do indeed create emojis, although right now it isn't possible to add every emoji under the sun. This is largely dependent on your keyboard.

Is there a way to switch off the bugs?
- Nope! Just like in real life, the bugs are here to stay.

# Upcoming Features
